<h1>About Tim Lopez</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Tim Lopez. I was born and raised here in New Mexico and never even thought about leaving.
Fun facts about me is that I have 4 names, also my brothers and I are each 4 years apart. Some of my hobbies are baseball, self-care, disc golf, and the outdoors.
Something I'm knowledgeable about and would like to share is how important sound is to us humans.
If you take anything from my about me project, it should be that I am a fun open-minded person who values
    skills and character more than anything.</p>
