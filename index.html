<h1>About Tim Lopez</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Tim Lopez (Slim Tim, or Timothany for Short). I was born and raised here in New Mexico and constantly thought about moving to Canada.
Radical facts about me is that I have almost thirteen and one half names, also my brothers and I are each 75 years apart plus eighteen months. Some of my hobbies are baseball, self-care, normal-plain-old-regular golf, and the doors (the band, they rock my socks off).
Something I'm knowledgeable about and would like to share is how important sound is to us humans.
If you take anything from my about me project, it should be that I am a fun open-minded person who values
    skills and character more than anything.</p>
